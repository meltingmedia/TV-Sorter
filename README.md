# TV Sorter

TV Sorter is a MODX Revolution CMP to allow you to quickly & easily sort your TVs using drag & drop.

## Requirements

* MODX Revolution 2.2+

## Notes

Before using TV Sorter, you will need to define a unique & incremented 'rank' for each TV attached to a template.
You can do so on the TV grid (once you have selected a template) by double clicking on the 'rank' column.
You can also "de-activate" each TV (by clicking on the checkbox), and assign them back. Doing so will automatically
give a 'rank' to each selected TV.
